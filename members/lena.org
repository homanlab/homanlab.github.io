** About                                                             :ignore:
Lena received her medical degree from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
Munich. For her dissertation, she focused on the effects of high
intensity neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the mortality of patients with
gastric cancer. At the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich, she
started out in the Department of Forensic Psychiatry, mainly working
with offenders suffering from schizophreniform psychotic disorders. This
sparked her interest in interrelations between neurobiological factors
and aggressive as well as impulsive behavior.
