Nils holds an M.Sc. in Computational Biology from ETH Zurich and the
University of Basel. He worked on translational research projects in
Orthopedics and Reproductive Medicine before joining the Homan Lab in
January 2024 to pursue his PhD in Neuroscience, focusing on language
processing in the brain using natural language processing (NLP) and
fMRI modeling methods. Specifically, he is interested in in-silico
models of dynamic processes, such as spatio-temporal patterns of brain
activation in response to language stimuli and during speech
production. Contributing to the TRUSTING project, he is working on
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify NLP metrics that most
sensitively track the underlying cognitive and neurological changes in
psychosis and schizophrenia. In his free time, he enjoys running and
cycling in the beautiful nature around Zurich and playing his guitar.
