After studying Applied Medical Sciences BSc at University College
London, Benjamin worked for various applied AI start-ups in
London. For his undergraduate dissertation, he analysed fMRI data to
investigate functional connectivity differences in patients with
epilepsy and a healthy control group. Through his avid interest in the
diagnostic and prognostic potential of language, he discovered the
DELTA-LANG project and joined the Homan Lab team as a research
assistant. He aims to continue his studies with an MSc in Zurich to
deepen his knowledge in neuroscience and psychiatry.
