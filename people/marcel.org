Marcel is a master's student in Neural Systems and Computation at
University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. He earned a BSc in Biomedical
Engineering from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, where, as part
of his final project, he employed whole-brain models to investigate
the pharmacological effects of different antidepressants in major
depression. With interests in neuropsychiatric disorders, brain
dynamics, and language, he is now doing a research internship as part
of the DELTA-LANG project, studying the organization of functional
brain networks in language processing with longitudinal fMRI data.
