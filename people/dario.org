Dario studied medicine at the International Medical School in Milan,
after which he commenced his psychiatry residency in the same
city. His interest for research started early during his university
years, where he explored the correlation between air pollution and
manic symptomatology. Lately he has shifted his focus to newer
developments in the field, such as natural language processing and the
implementation of digital health interventions for psychiatric
disorders. He is currently attending the Homan Lab as a visiting
student to gain exposure on neuroimaging methodologies and their
applications within the context of psychosis.
