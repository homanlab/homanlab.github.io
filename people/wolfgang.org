Wolfgang studied medicine at the University of Tuebingen and as fellow
of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation at Harvard Medical School
as well as the University of Oxford. Following his medical degree he
studied natural sciences with focus on mathematics at the University of
Zurich and completed his PhD in natural sciences with
Prof. Helmchen. Clinically, he received two years of resident training
in neurology at the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) and he is
currently resident at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Zurich
(PUK). His previous research work was focused on neural circuit dynamics
in the mammalian motor system and involved optogenetics, calcium imaging
and electrophysiological approaches. He currently plans to explore the
generation of motor symptoms in schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
disorder by combining fMRI in humans with optogenetic and calcium
imaging tools in mice.
