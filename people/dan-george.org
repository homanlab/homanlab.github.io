DG (Dan-George) worked at Google Zurich between 2013 and 2023 after
studying Computer Engineering at Politehnica University of
Bucharest. He decided to switch things up after climbing the corporate
ladder for 10 years, working on projects like click-through rate
prediction for the auction in Search Ads, network simulation tools for
edge traffic for Google Espresso and both internal tools as well as
end-to-end serving of YouTube Ads. He's now researching methods from
computational linguistics for understanding Formal Thought Disorder in
Psychosis for the TRUSTING project while also doing an online MSc. in
Psychology & Neuroscience of Mental Health at King's College London.
