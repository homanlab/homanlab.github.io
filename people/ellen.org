** About                                                             :ignore:
Ellen completed her PhD at the Schizophrenia Research Laboratory, NeuRA 
in Sydney with Profs. Tom and Cyndi Weickert. There, she assessed the 
effects of adjunctive raloxifene treatment for schizophrenia and 
examined the relationship between circulating hormones and brain 
abnormalities in patients. After performing a number of case-control 
studies, she became particularly interested in understanding 
heterogeneity among patients. She is currently investigating how 
inter-individual variability in cognition may be linked to 
inter-individual differences in brain architecture in psychosis.
