Lucia Bautista studied Biochemistry at the University of Granada
(Spain). She holds a PhD in biology from the University of Seville
(Spain) and worked a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute of Molecular
Health Sciences at ETH Zurich, where she gained extensive research
experience in the field of liver metabolism and physiology. After that
she enjoyed 7 years at the Liver4Life project (Wyss Zurich) actively
contributing to the development of an ex situ perfusion technology
aimed at rescuing marginal grafts and increasing the pool of organs
available for transplantation. During this time, she also obtained a
Certificate of Advances studies (CAS) in Clinical Trial
Management. This experience equipped her with a solid foundation in
clinical trial related concepts, medical device development and
regulatory guidelines. She joined the Homan lab in May 2024 as a
Clinical Trial Manager, where she combines her research background and
regulatory knowledge to support and coordinate the delivery of the
TRUSTING project Clinical Trial.
