Robert is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Human Medicine at
UZH. He studied Computer Science at UZH for two years before
transitioning to Medicine. His goals for his Master's thesis are to
explore the use of imaging and computational techniques to understand
how variations in linguistic properties of auditory stimuli such as
podcasts, narratives, or spoken language, impact brain activity in ROI
observed through fMRI.
