Akhil studied Biology and Data Science at the Indian Institute of
Science Education and Research, Mohali. After graduating he worked as
a Research Assistant at Technical University Munich with Valentin
Riedl. To further pursue his interest in cognitive neuroscience, he is
now doing my PhD with Philipp at the Homan Lab. In his project he will
mainly focus on dense sampling techniques to elucidate the nuanced
interpatient variability in schizophrenia.
