Yves acquired his master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from ETH
Zurich in 2023. During his studies, he focused on medical imaging
methods and the implementation of machine learning methods therein. He
pursued his interests in neuroscience in his semester project at the
EPI-Clinic Lengg and his masters Thesis at the McMaster University in
Hamilton, Canada. His master's thesis investigated the automatic
detection of Alzheimer's Disease within Diffusion Tensor Imaging data
using Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection. After gaining
teaching experience at the Literargymnasium Rämibühl he joined the
Homan Lab in June 2024 as a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience. His
PhD research focuses on the investigation of language processing in
the brains of psychotic patients using language models and correlating
the findings with fMRI recordings.
