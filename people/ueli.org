Ueli completed his bachelor's in psychology and comparative literature
at the University of Zurich and Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. During his
studies he developed a strong interest in the relationship between
language, thought and perception, which finally culminated in his
bachelor's thesis about the Sapir-Worth hypothesis and a tutorial at
the neurolinguistic department at the University of Zurich. After his
bachelor's Ueli completed a clinical internship at the University
Hospital of Psychiatry in Zurich, where he encountered language
impairments in psychotic disorders. His position as a research intern
in the [[https://homanlab.github.io/velas/][VELAS study]] enables Ueli to gain experience in linguistic
aspects of psychiatric research.
