Giacomo was born in Rome, Italy. He received his medical degree from
Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome before moving to
Switzerland. Giacomo is a third-year psychiatry resident. He has been
working at the ZÃ¼rich University Psychiatry Hospital since 2017. During
his psychiatry rotations, he has been exposed to patients suffering from
psychotic disorders, a topic that he hopes to further explore and study
in depth as his residency progresses.
