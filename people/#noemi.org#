** About                                                             :ignore:
Noemi studied psychology and biology at the University of Zurich. After
working as a clinical neuropsychologist at the Department of Neurology
of the University Hospital Zurich for almost 3 years, she decided to
focus on research full-time and is now doing her PhD with Philipp at the
IDP Lab and with Nicolas Langer at the [[https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/plafor.html][Methods of Plasticity Research
Lab]] at the University of Zurich. In her project, Noemi will apply
natural language processing, machine learning, and neuroimaging to
identify language markers that characterize the overlap between mental
health and illness in the psychosis spectrum (including schizotypy). She
was able to implement her own project idea within the framework of an
[[http://www.snf.ch/en/researchinFocus/newsroom/Pages/news-200214-doc-ch-snsf-supports-24-doctoral-students.aspx][SNF Doc.CH fellowship]] which will support her PhD for the entire period
of four years.
