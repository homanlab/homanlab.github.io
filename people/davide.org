Davide Staub completed his degree in Computational Science and
Engineering at ETH Zurich. His research has focused on developing and
applying scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques, particularly
during his time at Oxford and throughout his master's thesis,
primarily in the realm of Geophysics and Seismology. Before starting a
PhD in SciML, he is interested in exploring how these methodologies,
and machine learning in general, can be applied to new fields. Davide
has joined the Homan Lab as a Research Assistant, where he contributes
to the machine learning aspects of the TRUSTING and DELTA projects.
