Sophie received her medical degree at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in
Munich. For her dissertation she conducted clinical research in
palliative medicine focusing on assessment of palliative care needs in
oncological patients. Currently she is a second year resident at the
psychiatric university clinic. During her residency training, so far
in the acute psychiatric inpatient setting, she developed a special
interest in psychotic disorders and is hoping to gain experience in
psychiatric research in this field.
