We are always interested in hearing from people who are interested in
working with us. While we may not always have an immediate open
position, there are often prospective openings that could be relevant.

In general, having an idea of the sort of research you are interested
in is important so that I can assess whether your interests are
aligned with what we do.

postdocs in the lab do research in one or more of these three
areas: 1. computational psychiatry – suitable applicants will have
background in clinical psychology or psychiatry, and proficiency with
computational modeling, 2. model-driven investigations of learning and
decision making, and especially representation learning – suitable
applicants will have experience with computational modeling, fMRI and
clever experimental designs to test hypotheses, and 3. modeling of
neural and behavioral data from rodent studies – suitable applicants
will be proficient with reinforcement learning and computational
modeling.﻿
