A few months after our [[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2735440][paper on individual differences in treatment
response]] to antipsychotics was [[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2735440][published]], we are happy to share our
new paper on treatment effect variability in brain stimulation. Lead
by [[https://homanlab.github.io/stephanie][Stephanie]] and with contributions from [[https://homanlab.github.io/Giacomo][Giacomo]], [[https://homanlab.github.io/Lena][Lena]], [[https://homanlab.github.io/Ellen][Ellen]], and
[[https://homanlab.github.io/Maria][Maria]] this work evaluated the need for precision medicine in brain
stimulation. Interestingly, we found only little evidence for
treatment effect variability in brain stimulation, suggesting that the
need for personalized or stratified medicine is still an open
question. You can find a [[https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088831][preprint]] of this [[https://osf.io/8uxec)][preregistered study]] [[https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088831][here]] and
