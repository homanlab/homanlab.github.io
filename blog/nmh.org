We're happy to share that our new paper is featured on the cover of
the May issue of Nature Mental Health!

We found that increased genetic risk for schizophrenia in healthy
individuals is associated with subtle but detectable structural
changes in the retina. Notably, genes involved in neuroinflammation
were particularly linked to retinal thinning.

Our findings help to provide confidence that the genetic factors and
neuroinflammatory mechanisms which underlie schizophrenia affect not
just the brain but also the retina.

Congratulations to Finn Rabe and Lukasz Smigielski for leading this
work, and many thanks to our fantastic collaborators. Special thanks
to the pioneers of retinal imaging in psychiatry, including Steve
Silverstein, Paulo Lizano, Kathrin Nickel, Florian Raabe, Elias Wagner
and many others whose foundational work continues to inspire and make
new advances possible!
