We are pleased to share our latest publication in the American Journal
of Psychiatry:
[[https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230806][https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230806]].

Conventional studies of the structural differences between the brains
of people with schizophrenia and neurotypical controls rely on mean
differences between brain measurements. This can obscure the
heterogenous nature of schizophrenia, as it averages out individual
differences. Instead, we calculated the variability of cortical
thickness, cortical surface area, cortical folding index, subcortical
volume, and fractional anisotropy. This enabled us to provide novel
insights into the heterogeneity of brain measures in schizophrenia.

Lead by first author [[https://homanlab.github.io/Wolfgang][Wolfgang Omlor]], we found that individuals with
schizophrenia exhibit greater variability in cortical thickness,
cortical surface area, subcortical volume, and fractional anisotropy
within the frontotemporal and subcortical network. This increased
structural variability was primarily associated with
psychopathological symptom domains.

Unexpectedly we found that cortical folding patterns of the right
anterior cingulate cortex were more uniform in individuals with
schizophrenia than in control participants. This reduced variability
may indicate a less flexible interplay between genetic and
environmental factors during neurodevelopment.

We would like to thank everyone from the [[https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-schizophrenia-working-group/][ENIGMA]] consortium who
contributed to this insightful work.
