[[https://homanlab.github.io/members/2019/10/11/werner-surbeck-md-phd/][Werner Surbeck]] won a Travel Award for the [[https://sirs.societyconference.com/v2/][Schizophrenia International
Research Society (SIRS) 2020 Meeting]]. He will present his work at the
annual meeting in Florence, Italy. Werner is a trained neurosurgeon and
resident in psychiatry with a strong interest in the neurobiology of
psychosis, particularly in the ventral language stream and its
significance for semantic processing. With his approach that is guided
by insights directly obtained from epileptic surgery he aims to study
the neural correlates of thought disorder in psychosis. Congratulations,
Werner!
