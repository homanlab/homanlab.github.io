The journal [[https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/][BMC Medicine]] has invited [[https://homanlab.github.io/members/2019/10/12/philipp-homan-md-phd/][Philipp]] to join its Editorial
Board. BMC Medicine is an open access general medical journal
published by BioMed Central, and considered the flagship medical
journal of the BMC series. What makes this journal innovative is that
it operates a transparent peer-review system where reviewer reports
are published online alongside the article. In addition, BMC Medicine
makes transfer of manuscripts posted on preprint servers such as
[[https://www.medrxiv.org/][medRxiv]] particularly smooth -- authors are able to submit their
manuscripts directly, without having to re-upload files.
