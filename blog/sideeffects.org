In this new paper, lead by [[https://homanlab.github.io/maria][Maria]] and [[https://homanlab.github.io/stephanie][Stephanie]] and another fruitful
collaboration with [[http://www.psykl.mri.tum.de/evidenzbasierte-psychiatrie][Max Huhn and Stefan Leucht]], we asked whether the
need for the fashionable term precision medicine could be found in the
variability in adverse effects ([[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2735440][rather than treatment response?]]) of
second generation antipsychotic drugs. It is good clinical practice to
select treatment with respect to side effects rather than main
effects, indicating that there might be differences between patients
in their susceptibility to side effects; but how big these differences
really are was unclear. Interestingly, we did find good evidence for
variability in weight gain and prolactin elevation, suggesting that
these side effects could in principle be reduced through personalized
or stratified medicine, respectively. You can find a [[https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162727][preprint]] of this
