Schizophrenia is often marked by reduced motivation and difficulty
experiencing pleasure. In this new study, now [[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.02.25330758v2][online as a preprint]], we
asked why people with schizophrenia seem less driven by rewards yet
remain sensitive to avoiding losses. We examined 50 individuals with
schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 48 healthy participants while
they completed a decision-making task during functional brain imaging.

We found that healthy people relied more on goal-directed strategies
when pursuing rewards, whereas people with schizophrenia focused more
on avoiding losses. This shift was mirrored in prefrontal brain
activity. In particular, stronger loss-related activation in the
anterior cingulate cortex was linked to reduced pleasure and predicted
worsening motivation and social withdrawal over the following year.

Our findings suggest that people with schizophrenia devote more mental
resources to avoiding losses than to pursuing rewards. This imbalance
may underlie problems with motivation and pleasure, and it could guide
the development of new treatments.

Congratulations to Wolfgang, Giacomo, and Akhil for leading this work,
and many thanks to our collaborators.
