We are extremely happy to share that the [[https://www.bbrfoundation.org/][Brain & Behavior Research
Foundation]] has awarded a [[https://www.bbrfoundation.org/grants-prizes/narsad-young-investigator-grants][NARSAD Young Investigator Grant]] to [[https://homanlab.github.io/werner/][Werner]] to
study semantic and visuo-spatial processing anomalies in schizophrenia
spectrum disorders. Werner is a trained neurosurgeon and resident in
psychiatry with a strong interest in the neurobiology of psychosis,
particularly in the ventral language stream and its significance for
semantic processing. With his approach that is guided by insights
directly obtained from epileptic surgery he aims to study the neural
correlates of thought disorder in psychosis. Very well deserved and
congratulations, Werner!
