In our new paper we report results from a US multisite trial that
compared digital relapse prevention with usual care.
Psychiatric hospitalization is a major driver of cost in the treatment
of schizophrenia. Here, we asked whether a technology-enhanced
approach to relapse prevention could reduce days spent in a hospital
after discharge. The paper was just accepted and can already be read
as preprint
[[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/626663v2][here]], with
out the [[https://osf.io/yhvce/][code and data on OSF]].
