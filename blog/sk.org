will take place on March 6, 2020, at 3:30 pm at the PUK Zurich, Z105.

* Abstract
Apathy is a common and debilitating negative symptom of schizophrenia
and other neuropsychiatric disorders. While originally defined as an
impairment of motivation, apathy has recently been defined as a
quantitative reduction of goal-directed behavior. Treatment options for
apathy remain very limited, in particular for patients with
schizophrenia. In this talk I will present a research program that aims
to develop a model for apathy that spans the phenomenological, process
and neurobiological levels of description. Particular attention will be
paid to recent research that has identified dysfunctions in specific
processes underlying goal-directed behavior, including the generation of
options for action, effort-based decision-making and reinforcement
learning.  On the neural level the most consistent association with
apathy has been found for ventral striatal hypoactivation during the
anticipation of rewards, but recent studies suggest a more general
impairment of the coding of reward information. Overall, these findings
are beginning to suggest potential targets for biological and
psychological treatment approaches.
