We're usually happy to hear from people interested in joining our
group. While we may not have a current opening, opportunities often
arise, and we welcome proactive inquiries.

If you're considering getting in touch, it's helpful if you can
describe as *clearly as possible the kind of research you’re
interested in and how it connects to our work*. We’re particularly
interested in skills related to computational modeling, computational
linguistics, functional neuroimaging, and experimental design.

Questions? Please reach out to [[https://homanlab.github.io/people/2019/10/13/victoria-edkins/][Victoria Edkins]], our project manager
and research coordinator.
