We are always interested in hearing from people who are interested in
working with us. While we may not always have an immediate open
position, there are often prospective openings that could be relevant.

In general, having an idea of the sort of research you are interested
in is important so that we can assess whether your interests are
aligned with what we do. Hence, *please describe as specifically as
possible what you would like to do*. Skills that we are particularly
interested in are computational modeling and computational
linguistics, functional neuroimaging and knowledge in experimental
designs.
