We are happy to share our latest preprint, now live on [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18285][arXiv]]:
*Uncertainty Modeling in Multimodal Speech Analysis Across the
Psychosis Spectrum*, which is part of the [[https://trusting-project.eu/][TRUSTING project]]. This work
was led by [[https://krauthammerlab.ch/authors/rohanianmorteza/][Morteza Rohanian]] in collaboration with the labs of
[[https://krauthammerlab.ch/authors/rohanianmorteza/][Prof. Michael Krauthammer]] and [[https://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/nec/plafor/team/Leitung-der-Professur/Langer.html][Prof. Nicolas Langer]].
 
Mental disorders are often accompanied by speech disruptions. These
features have the potential to provide important information relevant
to diagnosis and treatment. However, they can be difficult to observe
and to accurately measure. They may also vary from person to
person. To tackle this, we built an uncertainty-aware AI model that
makes use of acoustic and semantic speech features to predict symptom
severity and psychosis-related traits.
 
*Why is this important?*

 - The model adapts to different conversation types, prioritising
   sound features in structured tasks and language features in
   open-ended discussions.
 - By estimating uncertainty, it highlights how reliable different
   speech markers (like pitch changes, fluency issues, and spectral
   instability) are for assessment.
 - It performed consistently well across various interaction contexts.

We believe that this approach could help with the early detection of
recurring illness signs and are excited about this possibility. Check
it out and let us know what you think.
