We are very happy to host [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ellen_Ji][Ellen Ji]] as a speaker in our guest seminar
series. Ellen is an expert in brain imaging of psychosis and bipolar
disorder and has recently published an [[https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-abstract/45/6/1367/5430123?redirectedFrom=fulltext][exciting paper on dysconnectivity
in psychosis]]. The seminar will take place on January 24, 2019, at 3:30
pm at the PUK Zurich, Z105.

* Abstract
Mounting evidence suggests that sex steroid hormones are implicated in
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and clinical trials of adjunctive
hormone-based treatments have been relatively successful. Moreover, grey
matter deficits and abnormal brain function are integral components of
disease neuropathology. Using a multidisciplinary approach integrating
structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging and molecular biology,
Ellen Ji will discuss how sex hormones and neurosteroids (estrogen,
testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) may be relevant to a number of
core deficits and brain abnormalities routinely described in
schizophrenia. She proposes that circulating hormones in the periphery
that cross the blood-brain barrier could be informative of brain
pathology and supports the idea that stratifying patients into more
homogeneous subgroups may be a promising approach to better
understanding the pathophysiology of psychosis.

* About the speaker
Ellen Ji is dedicated to understanding the pathophysiology of psychosis
and earned her PhD in the Schizophrenia Research Laboratory of Tom and
Cyndi Weickert at Neuroscience Research Australia. She did a
postdoctoral fellowship from 2017-2019 at NeuroSpin in France with
Josselin Houenou. Ellen has investigated the effects of adjunctive
treatments for schizophrenia and how brain-based and blood-based
biomarkers may characterise a subgroup of patients with
schizophrenia. Most recently she has been working on the
Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) study
to understand how short-range connectivity in superficial white matter
may be altered in psychosis.
