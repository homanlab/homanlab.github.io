* Why am I writing this?
After having shared a few outcomes on twitter that had turned out way
better than I would have hoped I realized (not for the first time) that
I'm probably contributing to an annoying bias in academia; and that had
to stop.

* What is acceptance bias?

* Is acceptance bias discouraging others? If so, why?
- The issue of being unexperienced
- Envy and its consequences. See De Tocqville.

* What about the vanity in self-promotion?
- Self promotion is vain only when it's too transparent
- One could argue that self promotion is unavoidable
- By mere visibility any act on social media is also self promotional

* Why rejection stings 

* Should we still aim high?
- Distinguish impact factor issues and filter failure from the necessity
  to rely on filters for others
- Thus, even when the CNS filter fails (and it does) you would probably
  still submit your prime paper there

* Why rejection should be the norm
- Too many scientists. But is this a good thing?
- How can we make them employable for others? Think skills
- How can we be empathic with people's (and our own) rejections and
  still keep rejecting when necessary?

* On the other hand: has competitive science worked?
- History may suggest otherwise: see Merkur essays by Caspar Hirschi
  (2013, 2018)

* The psychology of rejection
- Is it a rational strategy to expect rejection?
- Or is that a myth since you will be disappointed anyway?
