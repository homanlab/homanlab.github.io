#+DESCRIPTION: Members of the IDP lab

Located at the [[https://www.pukzh.ch][University Hospital of Psychiatry]] in Zurich, the Homan
Lab studies the origins and clinical consequences of heterogeneity in
psychotic disorders. Interested in working with us? Please start by

at the British Journal of Psychiatry. Philipp is Vicedirector and
Chief Physician (Stv. Klinikdirektor and Chefarzt) at the University
Hospital, and Principal Investigator of the IDP Lab where he is lucky
to work with a wonderful group of [[https://homanlab.github.io/people/][talented people]]. Philipp studied
business and computer science at the [[https://tuwien.ac.at/en/][Technical University]] and medicine
at the [[https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en][Medical University]] in Vienna. He completed his residency in
psychiatry (with Werner Strik) as well as a PhD in clinical
neuroscience (with Thomas Dierks) at the [[https://www.upd.unibe.ch][University of Bern]] in
Switzerland where he was Attending Physician at the [[http://www.upd.unibe.ch][University
Hospital]] and also led the Brain Stimulation Unit. He then did a two
year fellowship with [[http://labs.neuroscience.mssm.edu/project/schiller-lab/][Daniela Schiller]] at [[https://www.mssm.edu][Mount Sinai]], New York after
which he joined the faculty as Assistant Professor at the [[https://feinsteininstitute.org][Feinstein
Institute for Medical Research]] and the [[https://medicine.hofstra.edu/][Zucker School of Medicine]] in

*** Finn-Lenart Rabe, PhD. Postdoc

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/rabe.png]]

Finn completed his PhD at the Neural Control of Movement Laboratory,
ETH Zurich with Prof. Nicole Wenderoth. His research focused on
cortical finger representations and their changes in healthy and
tetraplegic patients.  His main goals at the Homan Lab are to i)
identify new biomarkers for psychosis by analysing the brain, eye and
speech and ii) describing inter-individual temporal changes in
psychosis using longitudinal studies.

*** Wolfgang Omlor, MD, PhD. Postdoc/Attending physician 

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/omlor.png]]

[[https://homanlab.github.io/wolfgang/][Wolfgang]] studied medicine at the University of Tuebingen and as fellow
of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation at Harvard Medical School
as well as the University of Oxford. Following his medical degree he
studied natural sciences with focus on mathematics at the University of
Zurich and completed his PhD in natural sciences with
Prof. Helmchen. Clinically, he received two years of resident training
in neurology at the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) and he is
currently resident at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Zurich
(PUK). His previous research work was focused on neural circuit dynamics
in the mammalian motor system and involved optogenetics, calcium imaging
and electrophysiological approaches. He currently plans to explore the
generation of motor symptoms in schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
disorder by combining fMRI in humans with optogenetic and calcium
imaging tools in mice.

*** Werner Surbeck MD, PhD. Postdoc/Attending physician

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/surbeck.png]]

[[https://homanlab.github.io/werner/][Werner]] studied medicine at the University of Zurich. After his training
in neurosurgery, he specialized in epilepsy surgery and functional
neurooncology before completing a PhD on the electrophysiological
investigation of the insular region. At present, he undergoes additional
specialty training in psychiatry and is involved in research projects in
the field of brain-based semantic processing abnormalities in
schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

*** Nils Kallen, MD. Postdoc/Resident physician

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/kallen.png]]

[[https://homanlab.github.io/nils/][Nils]] studied medicine at the University of Bern. He is currently a
resident in psychiatry at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in
Zurich and is interested in biomarkers of central system abnormalities
that may predict conversion to psychosis in high risk subjects.

*** Giacomo Cecere, MD. Postdoc/Attending physician

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/cecere.png]]

[[https://homanlab.github.io/giacomo/][Giacomo]] was born in Rome, Italy. He received his medical degree from
Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome before moving to
Switzerland. Giacomo is a third-year psychiatry resident. He has been
working at the Zürich University Psychiatry Hospital since 2017. During
his psychiatry rotations, he has been exposed to patients suffering from
psychotic disorders, a topic that he hopes to further explore and study
in depth as his residency progresses.

*** Rahel Horisberger, PhD. Postdoc/Senior psychologist

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/horisberger.png]]

[[https://homanlab.github.io/rahel/][Rahel]] studied Clinical Psychology, Biology and Art History at the
University of Zurich. She works as a clinical psychologist and
psychotherapist at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich. Her
current research activity for a dissertation focusses on the assessment
and psychotherapeutic treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia
(in collaboration with Prof. B. Kleim and Prof. S. Kaiser). The
development of brief psychotherapeutic interventions for psychotic
disorders in the context of acute inpatient treatment forms the extended
focus of her research interest.

*** Foivos Georgiadis, MD. MD-PhD student/Resident physician
*** Akhil Misra, MSc. PhD student

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/misra.png]]

Akhil studied Biology and Data Science at the Indian Institute of
Science Education and Research, Mohali. After graduating he worked as
a Research Assistant at Technical University Munich with Valentin
Riedl. To further pursue his interest in cognitive neuroscience, he is
now doing my PhD with Philipp at the Homan Lab. In his project he will
mainly focus on dense sampling techniques to elucidate the nuanced
interpatient variability in schizophrenia.

[[https://homanlab.github.io/noemi/][Noemi]] studied psychology and biology at the University of
Zurich. After working as a clinical neuropsychologist at the
Department of Neurology of the University Hospital Zurich for almost 3
years, she decided to focus on research full-time and is now doing her
PhD with Philipp at the IDP Lab and with Nicolas Langer at the [[https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/plafor.html][Methods
of Plasticity Research Lab]] at the University of Zurich. In her
project, Noemi will apply natural language processing, machine
learning, and neuroimaging to identify language markers for psychosis
and schizotypy. Together with [[https://homanlab.github.io/werner/][Werner]] and their [[https://homanlab.github.io/velas/#team][dedicated team of
students]], she is collecting data in the [[https://homanlab.github.io/velas/][VELAS study]]. She was able to
implement her own project idea within the framework of an [[http://www.snf.ch/en/researchinFocus/newsroom/Pages/news-200214-doc-ch-snsf-supports-24-doctoral-students.aspx][SNF Doc.CH
fellowship]] which will support her PhD for the entire period of four
years.

*** Janani Panchalingam, Master student

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/panchalingam.png]]
  
Janani completed her bachelor's in Psychology with a minor in
Biomedicine and she is currently completing her master's in Psychology
at the University of Zurich. She gained experience in two internships,
one in the field of eating disorders at the Privat Clinic Aadorf and
the other in early psychosis at the Psychiatric University Hospital of
Zurich. At the moment, she is working on her master's thesis
/Adherence in patients with acute psychosis: Analysis of the
influencing factors in a psychotherapy study with Motivational
Interviewing/ within the MIA-study.

*** Anna Steiner, Research assistant

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[../media/img/steiner.jpg]]

As a research assistant in the Homan Lab, Anna organises and
coordinates the day-to-day running of the [[https://homanlab.github.io/velas/][VELAS project]], which focuses
on semantic processing in the psychosis spectrum. She is also
completing her Master's degree in Applied Psychology at the ZHAW. Anna
previously worked in architectural offices for several years before
starting her second career in psychology. In her work, Anna
contributes her organisational skills and gains valuable knowledge and
experience in the field of psychological research.
