Ellen did her PhD with Cyndi Weickert with a methodological focus on
structural and functional neuroimaging. She is a former Marie Curie
fellow who was able to secure highly competitive funding for both her
PhD and postdoctoral training. She is also the recipient of 5 awards
from Australia.

Philosophy and History at the Humboldt University Berlin. He completed
his residency in psychiatry (with Erich Seifritz) at the Psychiatric
University Hospital Zurich and at the Department of Neurology of the

state functional connectivity in neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently
he investigates functional connectivity of striatal networks and
severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

Giacomo was born in Rome, Italy. He received his medical degree from
Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome before moving to
Switzerland. Giacomo is a third-year psychiatry resident. He has been
working at the Zürich University Psychiatry Hospital since 2017. During
his psychiatry rotations, he has been exposed to patients suffering from
psychotic disorders, a topic that he hopes to further explore and study
in depth as his residency progresses.

psychotherapist at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich. Her
current research activity for a dissertation focusses on the assessment
and psychotherapeutic treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia
(in collaboration with Prof. B. Kleim and Prof. S. Kaiser). The
development of brief psychotherapeutic interventions for psychotic
disorders in the context of acute inpatient treatment forms the extended
focus of her research interest.

* Stephanie Homan, PhD. Postdoc

Hospital of Psychiatry. As a clinician researcher, she is interested in
the question of whether or not patients respond differently to
interventions (antipsychotics, brain stimulation, psychotherapy).

[[https://homanlab.github.io/media/img/lab_nd.png]]

Noemi completed her masters in neuropsychology at the University of
Zurich and has worked as a neuropsychologist at the University Hospital
Zurich. In her PhD project she is going to apply natural language
processing, machine learning, and neuroimaging to identify language
markers for mental health and mental illness in the psychosis spectrum.

* Lena Hofmann, Doctoral student

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[https://homanlab.github.io/media/img/lab_lh.png]]

Lena received her medical degree from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
Munich. For her dissertation, she focused on the effects of high
intensity neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the mortality of patients with
gastric cancer. At the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich, she
started out in the Department of Forensic Psychiatry, mainly working
with offenders suffering from schizophreniform psychotic disorders. This
sparked her interest in interrelations between neurobiological factors
and aggressive as well as impulsive behavior.
