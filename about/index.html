<h1>About the Homan Lab </h1>
<p>
Located at the <a href="https://www.pukzh.ch">University Hospital of Psychiatry</a> in Zurich, the Homan
Lab studies the origins and clinical consequences of heterogeneity in
psychotic disorders. Interested in working with us?  <a href="https://homanlab.github.io/blog/2019/09/30/how-to-contact-us/">Reach out</a>.

Finn completed his PhD at the Neural Control of Movement Laboratory,
ETH Zurich with Prof. Nicole Wenderoth. His research focused on
cortical finger representations and their changes in healthy and
tetraplegic patients.  His main goals at the Homan Lab are to i)
identify new biomarkers for psychosis by analysing the brain, eye and
speech and ii) describing inter-individual temporal changes in
psychosis using longitudinal studies.

<a href="https://homanlab.github.io/wolfgang/">Wolfgang</a> studied medicine at the University of Tuebingen and as fellow
of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation at Harvard Medical School
as well as the University of Oxford. Following his medical degree he
studied natural sciences with focus on mathematics at the University of
Zurich and completed his PhD in natural sciences with
Prof. Helmchen. Clinically, he received two years of resident training
in neurology at the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) and he is
currently resident at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Zurich
(PUK). His previous research work was focused on neural circuit dynamics
in the mammalian motor system and involved optogenetics, calcium imaging
and electrophysiological approaches. He currently plans to explore the
generation of motor symptoms in schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
disorder by combining fMRI in humans with optogenetic and calcium
imaging tools in mice.

language, thought and perception, which finally culminated in his
bachelor's thesis about the Sapir-Worth hypothesis and a tutorial at
the neurolinguistic department at the University of Zurich. After his
bachelor's Ueli completed a clinical internship at the University
Hospital of Psychiatry in Zurich, where he encountered language
impairments in psychotic disorders. His position as a research intern
in the <a href="https://homanlab.github.io/velas/">VELAS study</a> enables Ueli to gain experience in linguistic
