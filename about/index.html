<h1>About the IDP lab </h1>
<p>
Located at the <a href="https://www.pukzh.ch">University Hospital of Psychiatry</a> in Zurich, the
Individual Differences in Psychosis (IDP) Lab studies the origins and
clinical consequences of individual differences in psychotic disorders.

<a href="https://homanlab.github.io/ellen/">Ellen</a> completed her PhD at the Schizophrenia Research Laboratory, NeuRA 
in Sydney with Profs. Tom and Cyndi Weickert. There, she assessed the 
effects of adjunctive raloxifene treatment for schizophrenia and 
examined the relationship between circulating hormones and brain 
abnormalities in patients. After performing a number of case-control 
studies, she became particularly interested in understanding 
heterogeneity among patients. She is currently investigating how 
inter-individual variability in cognition may be linked to 
inter-individual differences in brain architecture in psychosis.

<a href="https://homanlab.github.io/wolfgang/">Wolfgang</a> studied medicine at the University of Tuebingen and as fellow
of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation at Harvard Medical School
as well as the University of Oxford. Following his medical degree he
studied natural sciences with focus on mathematics at the University of
Zurich and completed his PhD in natural sciences with
Prof. Helmchen. Clinically, he received two years of resident training
in neurology at the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) and he is
currently resident at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Zurich
(PUK). His previous research work was focused on neural circuit dynamics
in the mammalian motor system and involved optogenetics, calcium imaging
and electrophysiological approaches. He currently plans to explore the
generation of motor symptoms in schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
disorder by combining fMRI in humans with optogenetic and calcium
imaging tools in mice.
