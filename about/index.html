<h1>About the IDP lab </h1>
<p>
Located at the <a href="https://www.pukzh.ch">University Hospital of Psychiatry</a> in Zurich, the
Individual Differences in Psychosis (IDP) Lab studies the origins and
clinical consequences of individual differences in psychotic disorders.

<a href="https://homanlab.github.io/ellen/">Ellen</a> completed her PhD at the Schizophrenia Research Laboratory, NeuRA 
in Sydney with Profs. Tom and Cyndi Weickert. There, she assessed the 
effects of adjunctive raloxifene treatment for schizophrenia and 
examined the relationship between circulating hormones and brain 
abnormalities in patients. After performing a number of case-control 
studies, she became particularly interested in understanding 
heterogeneity among patients. She is currently investigating how 
inter-individual variability in cognition may be linked to 
inter-individual differences in brain architecture in psychosis.

(PUK). His previous research work was focused on neural circuit dynamics
in the mammalian motor system and involved optogenetics, calcium imaging
and electrophysiological approaches. He currently plans to explore the
generation of motor symptoms in schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
disorder by combining fMRI in humans with optogenetic and calcium
imaging tools in mice.

IDP Lab and with Nicolas Langer at the <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/plafor.html">Methods of Plasticity Research
Lab</a> at the University of Zurich. In her project, Noemi will apply
natural language processing, machine learning, and neuroimaging to
identify language markers that characterize the overlap between mental
health and illness in the psychosis spectrum (including schizotypy). She
was able to implement her own project idea within the framework of an
<a href="http://www.snf.ch/en/researchinFocus/newsroom/Pages/news-200214-doc-ch-snsf-supports-24-doctoral-students.aspx">SNF Doc.CH fellowship</a> which will support her PhD for the entire period
